### Welcome to the **Data Preprocessing Module** of my Machine Learning Repository  
<div align="justify">

Before data can power decisions, it must be **understood**, **cleaned**, and **transformed**. This module is where that journey beginsâ€”where raw, chaotic data is meticulously refined into a structured, analysis-ready form. Think of it as the foundation of your entire machine learning pipeline. No model can succeed without a deep understanding of the data that fuels it. From uncovering patterns through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to applying crucial preprocessing steps like encoding and scaling, this module equips you to make your dataset truly model-ready. This folder encapsulates all pre-modeling tasks, ensuring that every downstream algorithm receives clean, coherent, and meaningful data.

Itâ€™s here that **hidden insights emerge**, **inconsistencies get resolved**, and **intuition develops**â€”forming the basis of robust, interpretable machine learning systems.

- Perform key preprocessing steps.

**Prerequisites:**  Basic Python programming and familiarity with essential libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.<br>
**Folder Structure:**

- `Encoding/` - LabelEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, OneHotEncoder, pd.get_dummies()
- `Imputation/` - SimpleImputer, KNNImputer, MissingIndicator
- `Feature Scaling and Transformation/` - StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, MaxAbsScaler, Normalizer, FunctionTransformer, PowerTransformer, QuantileTransformer

ðŸ“– **Your Companion: The EDA & Preprocessing Handbook**
<div align="justify">
To complement the notebooks, this module includes a detailed EDA & Data Preprocessing Handbookâ€”your go-to reference for all foundational preprocessing concepts and techniques. Whether to revisit theory or debug a notebook, this guide will keep you grounded throughout the data preparation process.
