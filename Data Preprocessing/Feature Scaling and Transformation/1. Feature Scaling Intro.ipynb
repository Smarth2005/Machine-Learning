        "In real-world datasets, different features often have different units, ranges, and magnitudes. For example, a feature like `age` may range from 0 to 100, while `income` could be in the thousands. Such imbalance can cause machine learning models—especially those based on **distance** or **gradient optimization**—to become **biased toward features with larger numeric values**.\n",
