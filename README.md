 ***“Machine learning is like farming or gardening. You put data into a growing system, and you carefully nurture it and prune it until you get something amazing.”***

Machine learning is not merely about writing algorithms—it's about **cultivating intelligence from data**. This repository is a curated reflection of my journey through foundational and intermediate machine learning concepts, projects, and experiments. Each notebook marks a learning milestone: from grasping the intuition behind simple linear regression to implementing more advanced techniques like classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Developed using Python and widely adopted libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib, this collection represents both academic exploration and genuine curiosity.  
Whether you're a student, educator, or enthusiast, I hope these hands-on implementations offer not just insights, but also a deeper appreciation for the art and science of machine learning.

### Repository Structure

- `Regression/` – Linear Regression  
- `Classification/` – Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM
- `Exploratory Data Analysis/` - Hands-on implementation of EDA and data preprocessing techniques.
- `Datasets/` -  Contains all datasets used in any Jupyter notebook or script within this repository. This ensures a single, organized location for raw, processed, or external data files used across EDA, modeling, and analysis tasks.
- `Mini Projects/` - This section contains my hands-on machine learning mini-projects, built as part of my learning and practice.
