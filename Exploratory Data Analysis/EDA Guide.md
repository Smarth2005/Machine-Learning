### Welcome to the **EDA module** of this machine learning repository.
<div align="justify">
  
EDA — Exploratory Data Analysis — is the **first true conversation with your data**. It’s where hidden insights begin to reveal themselves, guiding your approach to everything that follows: from data cleaning to feature selection to model building. Before you trust an algorithm, you must first understand the story your data is telling.

Exploratory Data Analysis is the first and most crucial step in any data-driven workflow. It involves:

- Getting to **know** your dataset  
- Spotting **inconsistencies**, **missing values**, and **outliers**  
- Understanding **feature distributions**, **relationships**, and **variability**  
- **Validating assumptions** before building models

### 📌 What You’ll Find in This Module

This section contains a set of structured notebooks and resources to help you:

- Perform a **systematic investigation** of any dataset  
- Use **visual and statistical techniques** to identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships  
- Develop **data intuition** that will guide every modeling decision


### 💡 Why It Matters

Performing EDA helps in making informed modeling choices and prevents issues that often emerge later due to undetected data quality problems.  
It ensures:

- Reliable, interpretable models  
- Faster iteration during the modeling phase  
- Improved understanding of underlying patterns and structures
